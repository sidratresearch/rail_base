def yaw_cache_create(**kwargs) -> Any:
    """
    Create a new cache directory to hold a data set and optionally its matching
    random catalog.

    Both input data sets are split into consistent spatial patches that are
    required by *yet_another_wizz* for correlation function covariance
    estimates. Each patch is stored separately for efficient access.

    The cache can be constructed from input files or tabular data in memory.
    Column names for sky coordinates are required, redshifts and per-object
    weights are optional. One out of three patch create methods must be
    specified:

    #. Splitting the data into predefined patches (from ASCII file or an
       existing cache instance, linked as optional stage input).
    #. Splitting the data based on a column with patch indices.
    #. Generating approximately equal size patches using k-means clustering of
       objects positions (preferably randoms if provided).

    **Note:** The cache directory must be deleted manually when it is no longer
    needed. (The reference sample cache may be reused when operating on
    tomographic bins.)

    ---

    Create the new cache directory and split the input data into spatial
    patches.
