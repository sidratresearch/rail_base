def quantity_cut(**kwargs) -> Any:

    Note that if a galaxy fails any of the cuts on any one of its columns, that
    galaxy is removed from the sample.

    The main interface method for ``Selector``.

    Adds noise to the input catalog

    This will attach the input to this `Selector`

    Then it will call the select() which add a flag column to the catalog. flag=1 means
    selected, 0 means dropped.

    If dropRows = True, the dropped rows will not be presented in the output catalog,
    otherwise, all rows will be presented.

    Finally, this will return a PqHandle providing access to that output
    data.
